# visibility information can be added to specific fields or entire files
#
# when a file restriction is specified, the default entry for the file will
# have its visibility set as specified
#
# when 'doc_parts' are specified, that denotes a set of fields which will be
# split off from the rest of the data and stored in a separate entry with the
# assigned visibility
#
# '{current_user}' is a special string which will be replaced with the current
# (logged in) user's primary ID, formatted as a Principal URN
# for details on the Principal URN format, see:
